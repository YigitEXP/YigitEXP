# Hey, I'm Yiğit! 👋

I am a 2nd-year Computer Engineering student at Süleyman Demirel University. I don’t just write code; I aim to design **"Bulletproof"** systems that bridge the gap between hardware and software.

### 🛠️ The "Swiss Army Knife" Journey
I believe a great engineer should understand the entire system lifecycle. I am currently building a diverse skill set to manage the journey from the factory floor to the cloud:

* **Backend & Full-Stack:** Developing reliable and secure services using the **FARM Stack** (FastAPI, React, MongoDB).
* **Industrial IoT (Learning Path):** Exploring how to interface with the physical world through **PLC logic (Structured Text)** and industrial protocols like **MQTT and Modbus**.
* **DevSecOps & Security:** Applying a security-first mindset by practicing **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** and focusing on secure deployment with **Docker**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Security & Deployment Focused)

| Domain | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Backend Development | Python (FastAPI), Node.js (Express.js) |
| **Industrial / IoT (Exploring)** | PLC Logic (CODESYS), Structured Text, MQTT, Modbus |
| Containerization & Runtime | Docker, Docker Compose |
| Server & Networking | Nginx, Linux, Bash Scripting |
| Security Mindset | OWASP Top 10 Awareness, Secure Deployment Practices |
| Data Persistence | MongoDB, SQL Server, SQLite |

## 🧭 My Engineering Pillars

* **Resilience:** Studying how systems fail to build them stronger and more reliable.
* **Clean Architecture:** Practicing maintainable and decoupled code inspired by "Clean Code" and "The Pragmatic Programmer".
* **Growth Mindset:** A curious student looking for the "how" and "why" behind every layer of technology.

## 🎯 Current Mission
I’m currently deepening my knowledge in **System Design** and getting ready for my upcoming hardware internship to see industrial automation in action for the first time.
