# Hey, I'm Yiğit! 👋

I’m a Computer Engineering student who enjoys building backend systems that are reliable, testable, and secure.

These days I'm less interested in “just making things work” and more interested in understanding how systems behave in production — performance, structure, and failure cases.

I like turning ideas into working services and learning what breaks along the way.

## 🧭 What I Focus On

- Backend development with Python  
- Designing REST APIs and modular services  
- Writing testable and maintainable code  
- Learning how scalable systems are designed  
- Building with a security-aware mindset

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Security & Deployment Focused)

| Domain | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| Backend Development | Python (FastAPI), Node.js (Express.js) |
| Containerization & Runtime | Docker, Docker Compose |
| Server & Networking | Nginx, Linux, Bash Scripting |
| Security Mindset | OWASP Top 10 Awareness, Secure Deployment Practices |
| Data Persistence | MongoDB, SQL Server, SQLite |

## 🌱 Currently Learning

Right now I'm exploring:

- System design fundamentals  
- Container-based workflows  
- DevSecOps mindset  
- How real systems scale and fail

## 🎯 Goal

To grow into a backend engineer who builds secure and scalable systems — and eventually move toward DevSecOps and system architecture.
